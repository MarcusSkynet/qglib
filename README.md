# qglib: The Official Toolkit for a Slightly Mad Theory of Gravity
### Version 0.1.0

A theory of quantum gravity is useless if you can't calculate anything with it. This is the calculator.

`qglib` is the Python library I built to do the heavy lifting for my [**Dimensional Collapse Theory (DCT-QG)**](https://github.com/MarcusSkynet/dct-qg). It's the engine that powers all the papers, predictions, and plots. It's here so you can check my math and, more importantly, so you can start playing in this new sandbox yourself.

### What it Can Do (So Far):

*   **Black Hole Geometry:** Calculate where the "Ledger" is supposed to be for any black hole.
*   **Echoes:** Predict the timing of the gravitational wave echoes my theory says should be there.
*   **Cosmology:** Figure out why the universe is the way it is (maybe).
*   **And a lot more.** It's all in the `/examples` directory. Start with `00_install_check.py` to make sure you haven't broken anything.

This is an early release. There are probably bugs. There are definitely weird variable names. Have fun.

### The Theory Itself

This library is just the tool. The actual ideas are in the papers. You should probably read the manifest first, so you know what you're getting into. (Link to be added).

### Licensing (Read This)

This is **GPLv3**. It's free for science. It's free for you to learn, to use in your own papers, to modify, to break. I want you to use it.

**The Catch:**
If you're a corporation and you want to use this code in your secret, closed-source product, you can't use this license. You need to email me and we can talk about a **commercial license.** My independent research is funded by my own time and the goodwill of the universe, but I'm happy to accept funding from for-profit entities who find my work useful.
